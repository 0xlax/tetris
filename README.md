## Tetris

**Tetris** : a game of logic and algorithmic calculations.

 This project challenges players with the timeless task of arranging falling shapes into complete lines, all while showcasing the technical prowess of Rust as a language for game development. Created as a means of learning Rust and inspired by the movie [Tetris]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BLM1naCfME").
